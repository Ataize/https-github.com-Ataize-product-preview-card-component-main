## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries for responsiveness
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts: Fraunces and Montserrat

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design using media queries and flexbox. I also practiced using different font families from Google Fonts to create a cohesive visual style.

Here’s a small code snippet showcasing how the media queries were used:

```@media (min-width: 670px) {
  section {
    display: flex;
    width: 600px;
  }
  img {
    width: 300px;
  }
}

```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on:
- Optimizing images for performance using formats like WebP.
